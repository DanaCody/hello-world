# hello-world

I am an amateur programmer who is trying to learn data science to eventually become a data scientist (hopefully). 
I have a Bachelors in Physics, and did some astrophysics research on exoplanets. I found that my favorite part about doing research was
analyzing the data. I got such a high from getting good numbers with low error. I would like to learn as much as possible.
